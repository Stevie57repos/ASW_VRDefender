I thought it would be fun to both learn and test how far I could push my Quest 2 with my simple flocking algorithm. 
Another reason why I thought this would be a great project is because oculus announced Application Space Warp for Quest 2 which is supposed to give you up to 70% boost in computation power. 

One of the key metrics that I was watching for is FPS and my main baseline goal to maintain at least 72 fps while getting as many of my flock objects on screen in the Quest.
